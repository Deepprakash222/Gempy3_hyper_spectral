## Task
1. Put Model creation in another file - dev4 - Done
2. Dictionary is added for creating Random Variable - dev2 - Done
3. Put conditon for what kind of model we want to run \ -Done
     1. Deterministic for mean and covariance for hsi data
     2. Deteterministic for covariance but a prior on mean
     3. Prior on mean and covariance
4. Automate the code wherever possible -Done
5. Add the model with Mean also along with Mode -In progress
6. Add the sumarry report of posterior - Done
7. Store and plot data for each chain - In progress
8. Cuda application of our code - Still need to be figured out
# Date :- 05.09.2024
1. Finish the plot:- combine all cluster data into a single plot with different colour representing each cluster between two different features - Done
2. Finish the script of previous task - Almost done
3. Check the implementation on cuda - Still need to be figured out
# Date :- 12.09.2024
1. Finish the script of previous task
2. Implement the chain
3. Any idea about fixing the covariance
4. Build initial model with other two dataset of KSL
5. Wishart Distribution
